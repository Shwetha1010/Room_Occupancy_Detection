# Occupancy Detection Using Sensor Data

## Project Overview

The Occupancy Prediction project aims to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on the data collected from various sensors. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 7 attributes, namely date, temperature, humidity, light, CO2, humidity ratio, and occupancy.


## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 7 attributes:

| Attribute      | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Date           | Timestamp of the observation                         |
| Temperature    | Ambient temperature in °C                            |
| Humidity       | Relative humidity (%)                                |
| Light          | Illuminance (Lux)                                    |
| CO₂            | CO₂ concentration (ppm)                              |
| Humidity Ratio | Derived humidity ratio (kg water vapor / kg air)     |
| Occupancy      | Binary target variable: 1 = occupied, 0 = unoccupied |



## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build an efficient binary classification model that accurately predicts room occupancy based on sensor data.


## Methodology and Results

To achieve this goal, machine learning algorithms, random forests was used and it gave an accuracy of 97%.


## Impact

An accurate occupancy prediction model can help optimize resource allocation, reduce operational costs, and contribute to sustainable practices. By integrating such systems into smart building infrastructures, organizations can achieve both energy efficiency and improved occupant comfort.
